# PHP To-Do List with Persistent Storage

A simple PHP project that demonstrates:

- PHP arrays and loops
- Handling form submissions
- Reading and writing JSON files for persistence
- Basic HTML embedding
- Input sanitization

## How to run

1. Install PHP (>=7.4) or use XAMPP/MAMP.
2. Place `index.php` and `tasks.json` (optional, will be created automatically) in your web directory.
3. Open in browser: `http://localhost/index.php`
4. Add tasks using the form; they will persist between reloads.
